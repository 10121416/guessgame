Greetings-

This is my third extensive try to get this project to properly show my updated files when it runs. It keeps defaulting to the base server and I do not know what I am overlooking. 

Last semsester in front end development I got stuck on the Java Script portion because I placed the .js file as a <link rel> instead of a <script src> and I lost hours of work because I kept writing java script code but nothing was changing.  I believe that I am living in that world again and I can not find the source of my problem.  
  
My project is not stylized properly I am certain because I can not see it.  I am sorry.  
I can guarantee I did learn this....
I can start a create-react-app.  
I can get the files
I can commit them to a repository.
I can commit my updated files.
I can not get my updated file folders to run properly if I have used my Atom editor.
I did try cleaning my cache.
If you get the app to work properly may I please know what you did.  
I would really like to figure this out.  I have wasting so much time doing it wrong it would be really helpful to know what I am not doing right so I may learn.
I started off wrong and I have not been able to fix it.  I tried at first to deconstruct and then reconstruct an app that was designed with the express intent for beginners to learn. All I learned is that I should have simply used one of the public API's suggested rather than thinking Douglass Minniaar's blog had the answers to my gaps in knowledge. My life would have been a million times easier.  If you want to see what I was trying to expand on here is his example: http://react-masterminds.drminnaar.me/

I did complete the other requirements of the class and I hope this does not fail me.  If I had time to start from scratch I am certain I would be able to fix this but alas I do not have that time.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
